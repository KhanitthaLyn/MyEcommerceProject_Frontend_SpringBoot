## 📚 Learning Goals

This project was built to:

- Strengthen **frontend development skills** with React and modern React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, useRef).
- Learn how to **consume REST APIs** from a Spring Boot backend.
- Practice **secure authentication flow** using JWT tokens.
- Build **scalable and reusable UI components** with Tailwind CSS.
- Understand the **integration process** between frontend and backend in a real-world full-stack application.
- Prepare for **enterprise-level full-stack projects** and potential **SAP/DevOps** integration in future workflows.

## 🧩 Future Enhancements

- Integration with real payment gateway (Stripe / PayPal).  
- Dark mode theme support.  
- Advanced caching and state management with Redux Toolkit.
- User Reviews & Ratings for customer feedback.
- Personalized product recommendations based on browsing and purchase history.
- Refund and order management system for smooth customer service.
- Wishlist / Favorites to save products for later.
- Search & filter functionality for easier product discovery.
- Analytics dashboard for admins showing sales, orders, and popular products.
- Inventory management to track stock and manage products efficiently.

⚠️ This project reflects my real learning journey. Some parts of the code may not yet follow perfect clean-code standards, as my current priority is to deeply understand the full system behavior before performing large-scale refactoring.

⚠️ Refactoring is being done incrementally as my understanding of the system grows.
